Dagger: Croak how do you feel about the foes we have faced so far?
Croak: Uhhh I am not really sure...
Croak: It was very mean of them to attack us and I am kind of scared of them.
Dagger: That is quite understandable my child.
Dagger: However it is important to remember that they are living breathing creatures just like you and I.
Croak: Even the heron?
    -> Yes
        Dagger: Sadly yes, even the heron deserves some decency...
        <<set $relationship += 1>>
    -> No
        Dagger: No! That heron disrespected the life of my children. We shouldn't do the same.
